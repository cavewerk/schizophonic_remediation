# New Project Alert 🚨
I should have started this journal earlier because at this point it's not exactly a new project, but better late than never. The ideas have been bouncing around in my head for a couple weeks too long, and now they've lost some energy. But writing about it helps. I am exploring alternative modes of transduction; computational-material/electro-magnet/resonant-string.

Maybe a good place to start is with a bit of a tag blast:
- [[schizophonia]]
- [[transducer]]
- [[translation]]
- [[resonance]]
- [[computational materiality]]
- [[computational composite]]
- [[unified-time structuring]]
## Integration Goals
Beyond documenting this project, I want to take this as an opportunity to up my obsidian/zotero workflow. How do I'm having issues with zotero integration rn, I should make an appointment with that librarian for the new year.

# Huzzah!

I got the circuit working, no more shorts. Arduino script updated, using uno R3 instead of nano, way better. I am able to target different harmonics in the string surprisingly effectively, and modulating the duty cycle has an interesting sound to it.

Current script allows me to sweep through frequencies using pot 1 and duty cycle using pot 2.
