# New prototype
Got a pretty cool functioning prototype today https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDqvUEZMlOw. Tune oscillator to fundamental, use momentary switches to jump through harmonic series. Found some interesting sounds. Finer control necessary, but still already pretty expressive.

So lets think mini projects/tasks:
- pulse width
	- direct control
	- lfo type thing
- Sequencer?
- basic patch with daisy seed
- [ ] movable magnet

Problems:
- fundamental way too loud
	- maybe just use fundamental for tuning and thats it?
- noise at lower frequencies

Right now there are two pretty accessible options to get something musical; keep it ambient and get finer pitch control (new, better pots) and maybe control over duty - or - we build some kind of sequencer.
