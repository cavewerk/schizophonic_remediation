# Arduino, Daisy Seed, and Version Control
I haven’t been doing good version control for the microcontroller script, mostly because I never intended to go this far just using an Arduino. The idea was that I would do a couple sketches on the Arduino and then switch to a daisy seed so that I could do the programming in Max, but I got a little carried away 😬

Now I wonder if it would make sense to use the daisy seed for dsp only, and rig up the arduino for all the sensor info.
