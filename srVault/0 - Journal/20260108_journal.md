# Playing

Playing was definitely the move. Found all sorts of interesting sounds without adding a ton of control.
## Drone/Ambient
Wild how it can hit multiple notes at once. Bass drones a little corny but it adds context.

## Plus guitar
This vibe feels like a real set closer.

# Future goals
## make it louder
The signal to noise ratio is a little fucked rn. Recording in a silent room kinda works, but just barely. Performing live would not work at this point. Need to find ways to boost signal
- [ ] add unison string piano style, this would also probably yield some interesting textures as well
- [ ] More control over duty cycle so lower harmonics don’t over pull, can put the electromag closer to string
- [ ] Better tensioning on string, better nutand bridge would just make the string more resonant
- [ ] Up voltage of magnet
- [ ] Get single stronger magnet 
- [ ] Build rig for more consistent transducer placement, paint node markers for reference
- More precise tuning of oscillator, maybe individual tuning for each target frequency

## Interface

### bespoke vs prebuilt

As of yet, the interface has been build from scratch and that has taken up the bulk of my time. It’s been fruitful to an extent, but has kind of limited the scope of my prototyping to functionality, with aesthetic development being largely incidental.

The main roadblock to trying out prebuilt interfaces is safety/risk of frying expensive gear. Maybe start with something like an sq-1. Frying 100$ would be sad, but not devastating, and if it works, this is a massive breakthrough that will save a huge amount of time and allow me to focus more on sound and start integrating the instrument with other peoples rigs. 

Building this out to be compatible with eurorack would be way more conducive to rapid iteration, but you also love Soma and the Lyra-8, and that shit is compatible with nothing. That’s what makes it so cool. It’s self contained and not like other instruments. It forces you to play in ways that eurorack would obscure, or maybe not obscure, but **it creates this path of least resistance that leads to the familiar.**
### sequencer vs direct gesture mapping

Direct gesture is where I’m at rn. I think an ideal interface rn would resemble the Lyra-8. Seperate pitch knobs for each pad. And maybe an octave shift, or maybe we have two groups of pads, half for lower range, reduced duty cycle, and half for higher range, increases duty cycle. That’s kind of like the Lyra.

Sequencer would be cool as well, completely different set of affordances, sonically, but also from a performance perspective. Less need to be hands on. Bespoke here could be interesting for more generative style sequences.

# sound

## embracing over pulling/buzz

Rn lower harmonics cause the string to buzz against the transducer. So far I’ve been avoiding this as much as possible, but this is part of the dynamic range of the instrument, like gospel bass growl, or fretless muwah. It just needs to be dialled in and deliberate. That also probably means bringing the signal on higher harmonics up so that dynamic range isn’t overbearing. The string clearly wants to buzz so let it buzz.
