# what to do when you don’t have time to work on the thing you want to work on
I haven’t been able to work on the thing itself in a few days but I still have ideas floating around in my head. Is it better to write about them or just put it aside? I guess anything it better than just have the ideas rattling around in my head, losing potency with each passing day. 

I guess the big lesson from this week is that setting myself up to play with the instrument is pretty much the most important thing I can do. Having the thing at home has been nice for that. I think beyond the freedom to just make noise, home has 2 advantages, I can mess around at night when the musical juices are flowing, and I also don’t have all my electronics shit at home, so I can’t get sucked into tinkering. I miss having a studio.

LK asked me if I wanted to book a show soon. Should it just set the date, or should I wait until I’m done this fucking paper. But the paper is done by 29th no matter what, so what’s the point in waiting. I should just set a date no? That’s litterally how you’ve done shows ur entire life. Why all of a sudden make such a big deal out of it. You set the date and then it gets done. You didn’t wait tilll everything was in place before agreeing to do this paper. 

# naming

It’s just occurred to me that I haven’t named the thing. [[Naming the thing 1]]
