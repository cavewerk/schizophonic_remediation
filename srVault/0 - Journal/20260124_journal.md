## Harp Interface
We set the key like you would on a harp and then strum. This way we avoid picking up forced induction.

## Speaking piano
What about a speaking piano? If this whole thing is about the expression of computational material through resistant materials, maybe this instrument has been moving in the wrong direction. Though, all the prototypes so far have really just been technical exercises, and totally necessary. increasing strings increases resolution. But then what is our relationship to fidelity? In a sense we would be doing a vocoder, but with a resistant, alive carrier. Maybe we need a studio where we can just plop a piano sound board and get to work.

Implementation: many strings, defined tuning, computational material is resynthesized, individual partials routed to best fit
