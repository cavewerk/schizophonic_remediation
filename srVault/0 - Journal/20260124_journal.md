## Harp Interface
We set the key like you would on a harp and then strum. This way we avoid picking up forced induction.

## Speaking piano
What about a speaking piano? If the inquiry points to the expression of computational material, maybe this instrument has been moving in the wrong direction. Though, all the prototypes so far have really just been technical exercises. increasing strings increases resolution. But then what is our relationship to fidelity? In a sense we would be doing a vocoder, but with a resistant, alive carrier.
